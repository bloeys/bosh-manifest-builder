* Helps devs of BOSH releases (e.g. Big BOSH releases)
* Helps users (e.g. don't have to go through the 'spec'; Can get up and running quickly)
* Integrates very well with 'bosh-gen'
* A lot can still be done with this
    * Some simple way of mapping instance groups with jobs
    * Possibly more metadata in the spec to automate even more of the manifest creation (e.g. if the property is a list or a map)
    * More features like not showing properties with default values
    * Automatically read provides/consumes (links) from the spec
    * Map releases to jobs
